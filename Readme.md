### A Full-Stack MERN Fake-Twitter clone of the Real twitter which is awesome.
- Workflow:
- Created the complete front-end using react.js first with all the components required and connected them using react-router-dom.
- First created the basic express erver then created the Schema's for storing tweets and user information and connecting it to MongoDb Atlas and storing them in the database.
- After the server and the database was setup and working I built the entire front-end using React.js.
- On completion of the UI I needed to work on UX so installed react and setup the store, actions and reducers along with the routes to send and retrieve user info to allow authentication and provide jsonwebtoken for access to private routes for Homepage and Profile Page.
- In the end I worked on adding the tweet feature with sending and recieving tweets from the database.
- There is a lot more but there is no point of going into the detail, for that you can go through the code.
- I enjoyed making it as I gave practical life to my knowledge and learnings, was a bit tiring tho.
- Feel free to use the code.
